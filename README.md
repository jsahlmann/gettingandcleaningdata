# Getting and cleaning data

Written by JÃ¶rg Sahlmann

## How the script works

x_train, y_train and subject_train data set will be joined into x_train by a additional common variable row_id.

x_test, y_test and subject_test data set will be joined into x_test by a additional common variable row_id in the same way.

x_train and x_test will be combined in data set all_data.

The activity id and the activity label will be imported and saved in variable activity_labels.


# Mapping of col number and sensor measurement
features <- read_delim("dataset/features.txt", delim = " ", col_names = FALSE)
# Change the variable names to more appropriate names which might serve as correct name without parentheses 
features$X2 <- str_replace_all(features$X2,"-", "_")
features$X2 <- str_replace_all(features$X2,"\\(\\)", "")

# Rename all columns to get the right sequence
names(all_data) <- c("activity_id", "row_id", "subject", features$X2)
# Filter for the columns with mean and standard deviation
vars_mean_std <- which(str_detect(features$X2, "_mean_|_std_"))
features$X2[vars_mean_std]
# Select columns with mean and standard deviation
all_data <- all_data %>% select("activity_id", "subject", features$X2[vars_mean_std])

all_data <- left_join(all_data, activity_labels, by = "activity_id")

## The result of the following line is the data set which satisfies
# - training and test sets are merged
# - only the measurement for mean and standard deviation are included
# - descriptive activity names are used
# - appropriate descriptive variable names are used
all_data <- all_data %>% select("activity", "subject", features$X2[vars_mean_std])
